# Create Links

Create Links is a frontend application that uses React to store and generate links, mainly for job hunting. Just add any link, autofill all the data in the URL, change / add data, and add it to saved links. Once the link is saved you can add it presets to save it for later, and once you have all the links you want just hit generate and all the tabs will appear (just make sure that popups are allowed for create-links.onrender.com).
